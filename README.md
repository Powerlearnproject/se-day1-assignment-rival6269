#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the sytematic application of engineering principles ,concepts, methods,and tools to develop and maintain high quality software.It involves
it is defined in 5 major steps which include; the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.
How important is software engineering in the technology indusry? It enables the creation of various applications and systems that power various aspect of life ranging 
from transportation, medicine,communication,entertainment,economy, commerce,environment etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three milestones in the evolution of software engineering are: The development of programming Language(e.g Fotran,C) ,establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s,and the rise of Agile technologies in the 2000s,and the avent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2.Design- Creating high quality and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface 
3.Implementation-It involves writing code and building of the software according to specifications 
4.Testing-Which involves conducting tests to ensure the software meets standards and functional requirements
5.Deployment-It involves releasing the sofware to the public 
6. Maintenance-It involves constantly checking for updates and doing them in order to enhance the software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall- This is a sequencial approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall e.g requirements,design ,implementation
2. Agile methologies- This is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,scalability,collaboration and response to change 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
2. Quality Assurance Engineer-A quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by executing testing plans and implementing them
3. Project Manager-The project Manager oversees the planning ,execution and delivery of software products 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs- The IDEs provides  comprehensive tools for writing ,debugging and testing of codes e.g Virtual Studio,Eclipse and intellij IDEA
2. VCS-These are software tools that used for tracking changes in the source code and coordinating work among teams members e.g Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges that are faced by software engineers include?
1.Changing Requirements - that is requirements may change during development cycle
2.Tight deadlines- This can cause the engineer to rush the work at hand ,thereby reducing the quality that should have come with a good work .
3.Technical Debt- This happens when the software engineer decides to take a shortcut to doing tasks which when accrued can impede development
Strategies to overcome these Challenges include Agile methodologies , effective communication,prioritization of tasks, and reqular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing-This involves testing just one component of the software
2. Integration testing-This involves testing interactions between multiple systems
3. System testing-This involves testing the entire software as a whole
4. Acceptance testing- This involves testing the software against user requirements to meet users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models .
Prompt engineering is important becayse it helps to ,make your questions clear and specific for the AI to understand according to context.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt- What are the health benefits of fruits ?
Improved Prompt- Can you pls state the health benefit of Orange?
The improved prompt is more effective because I tailored my question to one fruit . In this way , the AI can give me answers that are only related to the health benefit of orange
